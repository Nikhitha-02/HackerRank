def theLoveLetterMystery(s):
    """
        Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make a string
        a palindrome by only reducing characters.

        Rules:
            - You can only decrease the value of a character (e.g., 'd' â†’ 'c'),
              but cannot increase it.
            - The character 'a' cannot be reduced further.
            - Each single decrement counts as one operation.

        The minimum number of operations is determined by comparing characters
        from both ends of the string and summing the absolute differences in
        their alphabet positions.

        Args:
            s (str): The input string consisting of lowercase English letters.

        Returns:
            int: The minimum number of operations required to make the string a palindrome.

        Example:
            >>> theLoveLetterMystery("abc")
            2
            >>> theLoveLetterMystery("abcba")
            0
            >>> theLoveLetterMystery("abcd")
            4
            >>> theLoveLetterMystery("cba")
            2
